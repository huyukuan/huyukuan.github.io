The task can be formulated as an energy minimization with a determinant constraint. Widely used line minimization-based methods (e.g., conjugate gradient method) lack both efficiency and convergence guarantees due to the nonconvex nature of the feasible region as well as the significant differences in the curvatures of the potential energy surface with respect to atomic and lattice components. To this end, we propose a projected gradient descent algorithm named PANBB. It is equipped with (i) search direction projections onto the tangent spaces of the nonconvex feasible region for lattice vectors, (ii) distinct curvature-aware initial trial step sizes for atomic and lattice updates, and (iii) a nonrestrictive line minimization criterion as the stopping rule for the inner loop. It can be proved that PANBB favors theoretical convergence to equilibrium states. Across a benchmark set containing 223 structures from various categories, PANBB achieves average speedup factors of approximately 1.41 and 1.45 over the conjugate gradient method and direct inversion in the iterative subspace implemented in off-the-shelf simulation software, respectively. Moreover, it normally converges on all the systems, manifesting its unparalleled robustness. As an application, we calculate the static equations of state for the high-entropy alloy AlCoCrFeNi, which remains elusive owing to 160 atoms representing both chemical and magnetic disorder and the strong local lattice distortion. The results are consistent with the previous calculations and are further validated by experimental thermodynamic data.","tags":null,"title":"Projected gradient descent algorithm for $\\textit{ab initio}$ crystal structure relaxation under a fixed unit cell volume","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yukuan Hu (胡雨宽)","M.

Conventional block coordinate descent-type methods for the general multi-block problems store and operate on the matrix variables directly, resulting in formidable expenditure for large-scale settings. On the other hand, optimal transport problems, as a special case, have attracted extensive attention and numerical techniques that waive the use of the full matrices have recently emerged. However, it remains nontrivial to apply these techniques to the multi-block, possibly nonconvex problems with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we leverage the benefits of both sides and develop novel sampling-based block coordinate descent-type methods, which are equipped with either entropy regularization or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Each iteration of these methods solves subproblems restricted on the sampled degrees of freedom. Consequently, they involve only sparse matrices, which amounts to considerable complexity reductions. We explicitly characterize the sampling-induced errors and establish convergence and asymptotic properties for the methods equipped with the entropy regularization. Numerical experiments on typical strongly correlated electron systems corroborate their superior scalability over the methods utilizing full matrices. The advantage also enables the first visualization of approximate optimal transport maps between electron positions in three-dimensional contexts.","tags":null,"title":"Sampling-based methods for multi-block optimization problems over transport polytopes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nowadays, people adopt atomistic simulation to elucidate the mechanisms of experimentally known phenomena and to develop new materials by analyzing elemental combinations and structures. Building on ab-initio or (semi-)empirical force fields, atomistic simulation models materials at the level of atoms and seeks equilibrium states (including saddle points) and transition paths over the potential energy surface. One of the most fundamental tasks for these purposes goes to structure relaxation (also known as structure/geometry optimization)1.\nStructure relaxation can be formulated as an optimization problem in atomic positions (and also lattice vectors, if you consider crystals). Conventional methods are conjugate gradient methods (CG2) and quasi-Newton methods (QN3), as seen in the off-the-shelf materials simulation software. From the practical aspect, CG favors better robustness but is unsatisfactory in efficiency, while QN converges fast only around local minima. In theory, both these two lack global convergence guarantees, particularly when physical constraints are present. The physical constraints, however, are of significance in reducing the dimensionality of the configurational space and can be found in various downstream applications.\nRegarding structure relaxation, my interests basically concern with developing computationally efficient and theoretically convergent optimization methods catering for various applications. Currently, my collaborators and I mainly work on\ncrystal structure relaxation under physical constraints. By the way, I also pay attention to the effect of inexact oracles (or error propagation) on structure relaxation.\nCrystal structure relaxation under physical constraints Collaborators:\nXingyu Gao (China Academy of Engineering Physics); Xin Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences); Haifeng Song (China Academy of Engineering Physics); Yafan Zhao (China Academy of Engineering Physics); Xin Chen (China Academy of Engineering Physics); Junlei Yin (Northwest Polytechnical University); Zhen Yang (University of Science and Technology Beijing). We consider requirements from several contexts, encompassing relaxation\nwith fixed lattice vectors; with fixed unit cell volumes; under given external pressures. Notably, (2) is frequently seen in the calculations of the equations of state as well as material response functions, (3) finds itself in structure searches under high external pressures. Mathematically, (2) corresponds to a nonconvex determinant constrained problem, to which little attention has been paid from the optimization community.\nOur works largely improve the execution of the line minimization process, in which CG can easily get trapped. Roughly speaking, the developed methods imitate the Newton method by exploiting the curvature of the potential energy surface, yet with computational costs in line with that of CG. The overall convergence is ensured by an improved nonmonotone stopping rule for the line minimization process. Across a benchmark set with good universality, our methods achieve over 50% speedup against CG without any failure.\nWe have developed a suite called “ProMe-SuRe” for crystal structure relaxation with the above functions realized. The suite can be interfaced to some off-the-shelf materials simulation package. Static-link library files are available upon request!\nReferences\nY. Hu, X. Gao, Y. Zhao, X. Liu, and H. Song.

The variational argument leads to a universal functional comprising of kinetic and electron-electron interaction contributions, yet lacking a tractable expression.\nThe popular Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory2 takes a non-interacting reference system and lays emphasis on approximating the kinetic contribution. On account of this starting point, the KS model can fail to capture the true things for strongly correlated systems where the interaction energy dominates, even with the state-of-the-art exchange-correlation functionals3. Since strongly correlated materials find broad applications (e.g., high-temperature superconductivity, thermoelectric materials, and magnetic storage), new mathematical models and approaches are in an urgent need.\nSo far, a plethora of models have been constantly emerging, where the issue of high dimensionality often underlies. My interests revolve around analyzing their theoretical properties and developing scalable numerical approaches. At this moment, my collaborators and I mainly work on\nstrictly-correlated-electrons density functional theory4;\nvariational Monte Carlo methods5.\nStrictly-correlated-electrons density functional theory Collaborators:\nHuajie Chen (Beijing Normal University); Xin Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences); Mengyu Li (Renmin University of China); Cheng Meng (Renmin University of China). This model runs from the opposite face of the KS model and builds on a multimarginal optimal transport problem with Coulomb cost (MMOT). Leveraging a low-dimensional ansatz for the square modulus of wave function $|\\Psi|^2$, which takes roots in optimal transport and encodes two-electron couplings, one could derive a nonconvex reformulation for the MMOT. The number of unknowns therein scales linearly with respect to the number of electrons. Due to the intricacies of the nonconvex problem, existing works in this aspect consider systems with only two electrons.\nOur contributions:\nestablish the theoretical properties of the nonconvex formulation. Violating conventional constraint qualifications, the nonconvex formulation (denoted by (P)) itself is not appropriate for numerical resolution. Without extra assumptions in the literature, we establish the equivalence between (P) and a nonconvex quadratic programming (denoted by (P’)). Interestingly, we numerically observe that (P’) is “nearly” amenable to any local solvers;\npropose a global optimization framework trading off accuracy and efficiency. Enlightened by the idea of multigrid methods and optimal transport, we starts with solving (P’) globally over a coarse mesh and proceeds with merely local solvers for (P’) over finer meshes. The local solvers are fed with initial points constructed from the previous solutions. In simulations, electron positions mappings are first visualized in two/three-dimensional contexts; devise sampling-based methods as local solvers without cubic complexities. To alleviate the cubic computational burden in gradient calculations, we adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence and incorporate importance sampling-based matrix sparsification into iterative schemes. The resulted methods do not store and operate on dense matrices at all. Compared with conventional stochastic algorithms, our methods add randomness to constraints in essence. provide the first convergence results for the local solvers under realizable conditions. For better efficiency, the involved local solvers may invoke infeasible methods for subproblems. With infeasible iterates, the nonmonotonicity of objective values is inevitable, complicating the convergence analyses. Unlike the existing works, we show the convergence under realizable conditions. Novel convergence rates are also derived. References\nY. Hu, H. Chen, and X. Liu. A global optimization approach for multimarginal optimal transport problems with Coulomb cost.
