Conventional block coordinate descent-type methods for the general multi-block problems store and operate on the matrix variables directly, resulting in formidable expenditure for large-scale settings. On the other hand, optimal transport problems, as a special case, have attracted extensive attention and numerical techniques that waive the use of the full matrices have recently emerged. However, it remains nontrivial to apply these techniques to the multi-block, possibly nonconvex problems with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we leverage the benefits of both sides and develop novel sampling-based block coordinate descent-type methods, which are equipped with either entropy regularization or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Each iteration of these methods solves subproblems restricted on the sampled degrees of freedom. Consequently, they involve only sparse matrices, which amounts to considerable complexity reductions. We explicitly characterize the sampling-induced errors and establish convergence and asymptotic properties for the methods equipped with the entropy regularization. Numerical experiments on typical strongly correlated electron systems corroborate their superior scalability over the methods utilizing full matrices. The advantage also enables the first visualization of approximate optimal transport maps between electron positions in three-dimensional contexts.","tags":null,"title":"Sampling-based methods for multi-block optimization problems over transport polytopes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

However, recent studies have underscored the extraordinarily high computational cost of TPFs on quantum many-body problems, even for systems with as few as three particles. A key distinction in these problems is the antisymmetry requirement on the unknown functions. In the present work, we rigorously establish that the minimum number of involved terms for a class of TPFs to be exactly antisymmetric increases exponentially fast with the problem dimension. This class encompasses both traditionally discretized TPFs and the recent ones parameterized by neural networks. Our proof exploits the link between the antisymmetric TPFs in this class and the corresponding antisymmetric tensors and focuses on the Canonical Polyadic rank of the latter. As a result, our findings uncover a fundamental incompatibility between antisymmetry and low-rank TPFs in high-dimensional contexts and offer new insights for further developments.","tags":null,"title":"Complexity of tensor product functions in representing antisymmetry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yukuan Hu (胡雨宽)","X.

The task can be formulated as an energy minimization with a determinant constraint. Widely used line minimization-based methods (e.g., conjugate gradient method) lack both efficiency and convergence guarantees due to the nonconvex nature of the determinant constraint as well as the significant differences in the curvatures of the potential energy surface with respect to atomic and lattice components. To this end, we propose a projected gradient descent algorithm named PANBB. It is equipped with (i) search direction projections for lattice vectors, (ii) distinct curvature-aware initial trial step sizes for atomic and lattice updates, and (iii) a nonrestrictive line minimization criterion as the stopping rule for the inner loop. It can be proved that PANBB favors theoretical convergence to equilibrium states. Across a benchmark set containing 223 structures from various categories, PANBB achieves average speedup factors of approximately 1.41 and 1.45 over the conjugate gradient method and direct inversion in the iterative subspace implemented in off-the-shelf simulation software, respectively. Moreover, it normally converges on all the systems, manifesting its robustness. As an application, we calculate the static equations of state for the high-entropy alloy AlCoCrFeNi, which remains elusive owing to 160 atoms representing both chemical and magnetic disorder and the strong local lattice distortion. The results are consistent with the previous calculations and are further validated by experimental thermodynamic data.","tags":null,"title":"Projected gradient descent algorithm for $\\textit{ab initio}$ crystal structure relaxation under a fixed unit cell volume","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nowadays, atomistic simulation is widely used to elucidate the mechanisms of experimentally known phenomena and to develop new materials by analyzing elemental combinations and structures. Building on ab initio or (semi-)empirical force fields, atomistic simulation models materials at the atomic level, seeking equilibrium states (including saddle points) and transition paths over the potential energy surface. One of the most fundamental tasks in this domain is structure relaxation (also known as structure/geometry optimization)1.\nStructure relaxation can be formulated as an optimization problem in terms of atomic positions (and lattice vectors, if considering crystals). Conventional methods include conjugate gradient methods (CG)2 and quasi-Newton methods (QN)3, commonly found in off-the-shelf materials simulation software. Practically, CG offers better robustness but lacks efficiency, while QN converges quickly only near local minima. Theoretically, both lack global convergence guarantees, especially when physical constraints are present. These constraints are significant in reducing the dimensionality of the configurational space and are relevant in various downstream applications.\nRegarding structure relaxation, my interests basically concern with developing computationally efficient and theoretically convergent optimization methods catering for various applications. Currently, my collaborators and I are primarily working on:\nCrystal structure relaxation under physical constraints.

Junlei Yin (Northwest Polytechnical University); Yafan Zhao (China Academy of Engineering Physics); We address requirements from several contexts, encompassing relaxation\nwith fixed lattice vectors; with a fixed unit cell volume; under a given external pressure. Notably, (2) is frequently seen in the calculations of the equations of state as well as material response functions, (3) finds itself in structure searches under high external pressures. Mathematically, (2) corresponds to a nonconvex determinant constrained problem, which has received little attention from the optimization community.\nOur works significantly improve the execution of the line minimization process, where CG can easily get trapped. Our developed methods imitate the Newton method by exploiting the curvature of the potential energy surface, yet maintain single-step computational costs similar to CG. Additionally, to handle nonconvex constraints, we incorporate search direction projections onto the tangent cones of the feasible set. The overall convergence is ensured by an improved nonmonotone stopping rule for the line minimization process. Across a benchmark set containing over 200 structures with good universality, our methods achieve over 40% speedup compared to CG, without any failures.\nWe have developed a suite called “ProME-SuRe” for crystal structure relaxation with the above functionalities.

The variational argument leads to the universal Levy-Lieb functional, comprising both kinetic and electron-electron interaction contributions, yet lacking a tractable expression.\nThe popular Kohn-Sham DFT (KSDFT)2 uses a non-interacting reference system and focuses on approximating the kinetic contribution. The approximation error for the Levy-Lieb functional is called the exchange-correlation functional, which has no closed-form expression. Because of its starting point, KSDFT can fail to accurately capture the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems, where interaction energy dominates, even with state-of-the-art approximations of exchange-correlation functionals3. Since strongly correlated materials have broad applications (e.g., high-temperature superconductivity, thermoelectric materials, and magnetic storage), alternative models and numerical approaches are urgently needed.\nA plethora of models have emerged, often contending with the curse of dimensionality. My interests revolve around analyzing their theoretical properties and developing scalable numerical approaches. Currently, my collaborators and I are primarily working on:\nStrictly-correlated-electrons density functional theory4.\nVariational Monte Carlo methods5.\nStrictly-correlated-electrons density functional theory Collaborators (in the alphabetic order):\nHuajie Chen (Beijing Normal University); Mengyu Li (Renmin University of China); Xin Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences); Cheng Meng (Renmin University of China). This model runs from the opposite face of KSDFT and builds on a multimarginal optimal transport problem with Coulomb cost (MMOT). Leveraging a low-dimensional ansatz for the square modulus of wave function $|\\Psi|^2$, which takes roots in optimal transport and encodes two-electron couplings, one could derive a nonconvex reformulation for the MMOT. The number of unknowns therein scales linearly with respect to the number of electrons. Due to the intricacies of the nonconvex problem, existing works in this aspect consider systems with only two electrons.\nOur contributions include:\nEstablishing the theoretical properties of the nonconvex formulation. The nonconvex formulation (denoted as (P)) is not suitable for numerical resolution due to violating conventional constraint qualifications. We establish the equivalence between (P) and a nonconvex quadratic programming (denoted as (P’)) without additional assumptions from the literature. Interestingly, we numerically observe that (P’) is “nearly” amenable to any local solvers.\nProposing a multigrid optimization framework balancing accuracy and efficiency. Inspired by the multigrid methods and optimal transport, we starts with solving (P’) accurately over a coarse mesh and proceeds with local solvers for (P’) over finer meshes. The local solvers are fed with initial points constructed from the previous solutions. In simulations, electron positions mappings are first visualized in two/three-dimensional contexts. Devising sampling-based methods as local solvers without cubic complexities. To reduce the cubic computational burden in gradient calculations, we adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence and incorporate importance sampling-based matrix sparsification into iterative schemes. These methods avoid storing and operating on dense matrices. Compared with conventional stochastic algorithms, our methods add randomness to constraints. Providing the first convergence results for the local solvers under realizable conditions. To enhance efficiency, local solvers may use infeasible methods for subproblems. With infeasible iterates, nonmonotonicity of objective values is inevitable, complicating convergence analyses.
